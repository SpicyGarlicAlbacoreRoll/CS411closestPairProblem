# CS411closestPairProblem

Two solutions to the closest pair problem using divide and conquer &  brute force algorithms.

The divide and conquer runs in O(nlog^2(n)) time
The brute force method runs in O(n^2) time

Data is given to algorithms pre-sorted


BUILD INSTRUCTIONS (Tested on GNU, CLANG, and MSVC)

from the project's root directory,

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ../
    cmake --build .

On Linux output is to build/closestPair

Windows will be to build/Debug/closestPair.exe
